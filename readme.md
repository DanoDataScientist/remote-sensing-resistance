Remote sensing resilience
================

This repository represents the entirety of the "remote sensing resilience" project which seeks to address the question: Does heterogeneity in forest structure make a forest resistant to wildfire? That is, does greater heterogeneity decrease wildfire severity when a fire inevitably occurs?

We rely on Google Earth Engine and R as our GIS. All Earth Engine code is in the ee-remote-sensing-resistance folder, which is itself a repository housed in Google's version control system. We mirror it here such that this repository remains a complete representation of the project.

The written manuscript is in the ms folder. The primary document is a .Rmd file, which is rendered as a .docx and as a .pdf. The .pdf is viewable on GitHub. I'm hoping this setup will allow programming-savy co-authors to interact with the code and the writing through the same version control framework, but also allow some flexibility for a more-typical "track changes on a Microsoft Word document" sort of relationship with the work.
