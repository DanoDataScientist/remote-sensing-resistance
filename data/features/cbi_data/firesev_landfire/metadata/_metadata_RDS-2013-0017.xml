      <abstract>This set of Composite Burn Index (CBI) data was collected from 2009 to 2011 and supports several products created during the FIRESEV project, which was funded by the Joint Fire Sciences Program. FIRESEV (FIRE SEVerity mapping tools) is a comprehensive set of tools and protocols to deliver, create, and evaluate fire severity maps for all phases of fire management. This CBI data describes fire effects for the western U.S. for five vegetation strata after burning in 2008 to 2010 (Key and Benson 1999). The strata include substrates (litter, duff, fuel, and soil); herbs, low shrubs, and small trees; tall shrubs and sapling trees; intermediate trees; and big trees. The field assessments were conducted in deciduous and coniferous forests, shrublands, and grasslands. The dataset includes information on the fires that burned each area, plot locations and sample protocols, topographic characteristics, canopy characteristics, substrate and ground covers, pre- and post-burn estimates of vegetation in each stratum, estimates of the percentage of plot altered by stratum, CBI values calculated for each of the five strata, and a composite CBI value for the entire plot. Field photos at each location are included for perspective on the field conditions related to the CBI assessments.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were collected to support the following major FIRESEV products: (1) a Severe Fire Potential Map (SFPM), which quantified the potential for fires to burn with high severity, should they occur, for any 30 meter (m) x 30 m piece of ground across the western United States (not including Alaska or Hawaii); (2) a fire severity mapping algorithm in the Wildland Fire Assessment Tool (WFAT), which was used to map predicted fire severity explicitly from fire effects simulation models (e.g., the First Order Fire Effects Model, the CONSUME model, and others) for real-time and planning wildfire applications; and (3) a suite of research studies, synthesis papers, and popular articles, which improved the description, interpretation, and mapping of fire severity for wildland fire managers. Our primary purpose for this sampling effort was to collect field data that could be used to assess the accuracy of the maps produced to quantify the probability of severe fires for the western US. In addition, data were collected to analyze the degree to which various measures of burn severity interpreted from satellite imagery (NBR, dNBR, RdNBR) correlated with field indicators of burn severity collected one year post-fire. We sought to assess measures in the field and remotely that related to three different axes of burn severity used in this project. These included 1) soil heating, 2) surface fuel consumption, and 3) change in vegetation cover and mortality. The CBI values comprising this collection were used in each of these products, either directly or indirectly, to compare on-site changes in vegetation, canopy structure, and soil characteristics with fire severity interpretations and assessments derived from satellite imagery. All of the products were based either directly or indirectly on the CBI dataset in this archive.</purpose>

      <descgeog>The CBI plots span 10 states in the western United States. The northernmost plot is in north central Washington, easternmost is in New Mexico, southernmost is in western Texas, and the westernmost is in northern California. Each set of CBI plots is located within a burned area perimeter.</descgeog>

          <classmod>There were a few species that were not available in ITIS. For these cases, the PLANTS Database was used to obtain the classification. Below is a list of those exceptions:

1. Chionosphaera apobasidialis - this species was not found in ITIS, so we used the PLANTS taxonomy.

2. Arenaria aberrans - this species was in ITIS, but was not accepted, so we used the PLANTS taxonomy.

3. Pascopyrum smithii - this species had 2 sets of taxonomy, but the one the author would like to use is not accepted, so we used the PLANTS taxonomy.</classmod>

      <attraccr>Composite Burn Index (CBI) is a visual method of assessing the change in soil and vegetation characteristics due to burning. The scale ranges from zero to three, with a separate number assigned to each of five vegetation strata (Key and Benson 2006).  Indices for all strata are averaged for an overall CBI index at a plot.  

The CBI index represents the change between pre-fire and post-fire conditions.  It most accurately assesses the magnitude of vegetation and soil change, rather than the current conditions on the ground (Robichaud et al. 2007).  The changes are qualitative, not quantitative, and prone to subjectivity because they are visual estimations (Chuvieco 2009).  

Complicating the visual estimations of burn severity for CBI is that fact that pre-fire conditions are often hard to assess in large burned areas.  Patches of unburned areas to compare with the burned areas may not be available. When they are available, the vegetation community may not exactly match for burned and unburned areas.  In addition, most burned areas have a high degree of spatial variation in intensity and fire effects (Lutes 2007).  It can be challenging to find areas that represent conditions in the majority of the fire-affected areas and, in turn, to accurately estimate the burn severity in those areas using only ground measurements (Chen et al. 2011).  

Summaries of the problems with collecting CBI data and making visual assessments of fire damage consistently and accurately have been enumerated by Key and Benson (1999), Kasischke et al. (2008), DeSantis and Chuvieco (2009), Tanase et al. (2011), and many others.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Consistency of CBI evaluations can vary depending on the amount of time that has passed between burning and the CBI assessment. The severity of the burn and the time since burning affect vegetation recovery times, which in turn affect post-burn assessments. For the FIRESEV study, all CBI assessments were conducted one-year post burn in the conifer forests, grasslands, and shrublands.

Several field crews evaluated CBI for this study. The composition varied among fire years, especially in Montana. Each crew member brought different experiences with burn severity, knowledge of fire effects, and expertise in visual estimation to the job. Even though all crews were trained in estimating CBI using the Key and Benson (2006) methods and in filling out the CBI form, these differences within and among crews most likely affected consistency of CBI index estimations. However, it was not possible to assign a value to inconsistency among crews or how the inconsistency may have affected the CBI values from one location to another.

After returning from the field, an initial quality check was performed to make sure necessary data fields were properly filled in, and minor corrections were made where necessary. Data entry of the CBI field values were analyzed visually for typographic errors, as well as plotted in Excel graphs to check for outliers.</logic>
    <complete>Sites were included in the FIRESEV study based on the geographic range required for the Severe Fire Potential Map (SFPM) map to cover the western United States.  Fire locations were selected for CBI assessments based on the time since burn and accessibility to the field crews. CBI locations were also required to be spread throughout the study area and fill data gaps where CBI plots could not be located from other agencies or organizations. The project required that an overall CBI value (total) at each location be estimated (at minimum) so that field assessments of fire severity could be compared with the remotely-sensed values of fire severity (dNBR and RdNBR) provided by the Monitoring and Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program.

In this study, we use the term burn severity to denote the (1) classifications created for remote sensing applications and (2) magnitude of fire-caused damage to vegetation and fuels and general descriptions of fire impacts, such as fire effects on soil.  Both uses denote changes to the burned area one-year post fire as defined by Lentil et al. 2006 (Dillon et al. 2011; Lentile et al. 2006; Lentile et al. 2007; Simard 1991). We use the term fuels to mean surface fuels, and fuel consumption to mean the destruction of fuels during the combustion process. Fire effects are restricted to first-order fire effects that occur as a direct result of the combustion process. A CBI plot is a single location where CBI assessments have been conducted on a set of strata (within a single CBI form). Burn perimeters are areas defined and mapped by MTBS as the maximum extent of each fire. Strata include substrate (ground conditions) and distinct vegetation layers based on canopy height.

Complete CBI assessments were composed of estimates from all stata present in a plot.  Several plots with CBI assessments used in this study did not include CBI index values for all strata; this means that all strata were not present at these plots.  Of the 543 plots collected for the FIRESEV project , all had an overall (i.e., total CBI) value for total vegetation and soil change in the plot; 111 of these have data for fewer than five individual strata.</complete>

        <methdesc>We looked at all large fires that had burned within the study area (conterminous western U.S.) one year prior to when a sample would be taken. Plots were located opportunistically to represent areas of different burn severity levels, cover types, and successional stages. Primary objectives in locating plots were to: a) capture the diversity of sites that exist within a burned area, and b) get a wide geographic distribution of samples. However, we also chose locations that we could get to easily. Locations for sampling were rejected if they were not large enough to allow for a 90 meter x 90 meter area to be sampled, with that area relatively uniform with respect to overstory density and fire severity. 

Within locations subjectively chosen to be representative of a set of conditions, we randomly located plot center by taking a random number of paces (between 2 and 10) in a randomly chosen azimuth. This plot center had to be at least 90 meters from a road or stand boundary. All plots were 1/10 acre (400 square meters) fixed-area circular macroplots with a radius of 37.2 feet (11.3 meters). 

FIREMON (Fire effects monitoring and inventory system) sampling protocols were used as the template for sampling in this study.  See Dillon and Morgan (2009) for more details, as well as Key and Benson (2006).

Strata Definitions: 
With the CBI, fire effects are assessed somewhat independently within strata because vertical levels in a community have different biophysical components, and multiple levels impart structural complexities that profoundly influence fire behavior. Structure affects how wind shapes fire and the nature of available fuels. Though strata are spatially contiguous, each level may have unique combustible properties and effects may differ strongly between them. At times in the field, one may find vague or discontinuous boundaries between strata where distinctions are not always clear cut. In such cases, try to reach consensus on what is included or excluded from each stratum and be consistent from plot to plot. If distinctions between some strata cannot be resolved, it may help to simplify the overall structure; try combining strata, or drop one out. Even if only one factor in a stratum appears to be applicable, continue to score that stratum. The main objective is to make reasonable interpretations on one to five factors within each stratum, and then to combine those to derive composite ratings that summarize severity over the overstory, understory, and the total plot. The goal is not so much a high degree of precision in rating a specific factor, as it is a consistent summary rating of severity that aggregates a variety of burn effects over multiple levels of the plot.

The strata listed below are commonly identified in a complex forest community, segregated principally by the vertical space they occupy. Their arrangement and component parts determine, to some extent, the character and connectivity of fuel, variation in flammability, and timing of seasonal drying. When evaluating burn severity with the CBI, fuel and fire behavior relationships are emphasized while strata species composition is less important. Because species may exhibit multiple life forms and occupy several strata, consider primarily where individual plants or other materials fit within pre-fire community structure.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Field data were collected on paper field forms. After returning from the field, an initial quality check was performed to make sure necessary data fields were properly filled in, and minor corrections were made where necessary. Data were subsequently entered into tables in the Access database, FIRESEV_FieldData_Codes.accdb, using entry forms. The paper FIRESEV PD Form was entered into 
_PD table via the FIRESEV PD Form in Access; the paper FIRESEV Burn Severity Form was entered into the FIRESEV_Burn_Severity table via the FIRESEV Burn Severity Form in Access.

Next, estimates recorded in the field for burn severity needed to be converted to the 0 to 3 Composite Burn Index (CBI) scale. The FIRESEV_Burn_Severity table includes many field variables, organized into six strata from the soil surface (stratum A) up through tall trees (stratum F). We estimated many burn severity variables as percentages in the field. Recording cover class midpoints, our actual values for these variables ranged from 0 to 98. To convert these to a 0 to 3 scale required dividing the recorded values by 32.67. One variable, Spp Comp-Rel Abundance in strata B and C, was recorded as categorical in the field: unchanged, low, moderate, or high. We converted these to the CBI scale by assigning them to 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Similarly, diameter of smallest branch in strata B and C was recorded using categorical values of 0, 1, 2, 3, and these were taken directly to represent the CBI scale.</procdesc>
        <procdate>2012</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We used an R script called cbi_recode.r to perform all the conversion of variables to the CBI scale, and subsequently calculate CBI values for each sample stratum and for the plot as a whole. This script first reads in a CSV file export of the FIRESEV_Burn_Severity table. It then calculates a version of each variable on the 0 to 3 CBI scale. To calculate CBI for any given stratum, the script calculates the mean of all variables recorded for that stratum; if a variable is blank, it is simply not included in the calculation. The script calculates the overall plot CBI value as the average of CBI across all strata. On non-forested plots (all null values in the tree strata: C, D, E, or F), values for B1 and B2 strata are used in calculation of the overall plot CBI. On forested plots (any non-null values in tree strata), the value for the combined B strata is used. Since we were unsure of the usefulness of the smallest branch diameter variable, we also calculated CBI values both with and without this variable. Lastly, we also used the script to calculate GeoCBI, a modified version of the overall plot CBI where each stratum-level CBI value is weighted by the fractional cover of that stratum in the final calculation. We calculated GeoCBI using both the pre-fire and post-fire FCov (fractional cover) values recorded in the field.

The output of the R script was a CSV file called cbi_calc.csv with the calculated values of each variable on the 0 to 3 scale, and all the stratum and plot-level CBI and GeoCBI values. This CSV file was then imported back into the Access database as the FIRESEV_cbi_calc table.</procdesc>
        <procdate>Unknown</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Data from the Access database file were exported to an XLSX and CSV file so that data are available in multiple formats. 

In the process or preparing data for archiving we discovered a couple of species codes that we believe were incorrect, so we made the following adjustments.

1. For PLOTID = 3312, C_TwgSpp was = PUTR. We believe this was misentered, so the species was changed to PUTR2.

2. For PLOTID = 211001, B_TwgSpp was = ROWI. We believe this was misentered, so the species was changed to ROWO.</procdesc>
